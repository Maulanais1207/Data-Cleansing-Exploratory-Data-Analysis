# Data Cleansing
Data cleaning means:
- correcting/addressing any mistakes in the data
- organising the data in ways to help the downstream analysis e.g., clearer variable names, factor levels, data transformation

Execution in cleaning data is simply divided into two, namely data imputation and data amputation.
## Data amputation
Data amputation is performed if the data condition shows too many empty data (null) or too many unique data and other considerations.
## Data imputation
There are several ways in imputing data.
 - Data imputation with mean can be done for data that is normally distributed
 - Data imputation with median can be done for skewness data
 - Data imputation with mode can be performed for categorical data
